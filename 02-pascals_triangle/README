 * pascals_triangle.java JDK 14
 * 
 * WHAT THIS PROGRAM WAS SUPPOSED TO DO:
 * 
 * Compute Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.
 * In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

* WHAT THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY DOES
* 
* Computes 11 to the power of a user entered Integer, 0 - ?
* 
* WHAT I LEARNED
* 
* While searching for a way to make this program, I came across this page on
* Pascal's triangle https://www.mathsisfun.com/pascals-triangle.html
* It stated that 11^? works to find Pascal's Triangle. 
* I later realized that stops working at 11^5 because the numbers start to roll over;
* A fact that I had initially glossed over in my excitement, whoops!
* 
* Not to be deterred, I decided to use this as a learning experience to work on:
*
* A. Setting up JDK 14 on Windows machine and library's https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html
* B. IO in Java https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api/java.base/java/util/class-use/Scanner.html
* C. Command line menu's in Java and returning numbers in an Int format instead of Double
* D. Recursive calls in Java
* E. Finally, I learned a lot by trying to accomplish things in Java that I've already done in C/C++
